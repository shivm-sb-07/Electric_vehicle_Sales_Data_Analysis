##

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) sales data across various states in India for 2023 and 2024. The goal is to provide actionable insights into customer preferences, government influence, and infrastructure development, with a focus on creating visually engaging and informative dashboards in Power BI.

## Key Points for Analysis :

1. Sales Analysis by State
    - Compare EV sales data across different states to identify regions with high or low adoption rates.
    - Highlight the distribution of 4-wheeler EV sales across urban and rural areas.

2. Customer Motivation for Choosing EVs
    - Cost Savings: Analyze trends in EV purchases driven by lower operational and maintenance costs.
    - Environmental Concerns: Measure the impact of increasing awareness of climate change and air pollution on EV adoption.
    - Government Incentives: Evaluate how subsidies and policies influence EV sales in different states.

3. Government Policy Impact
    - State-wise Subsidies: Highlight top-performing states like Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu in offering substantial EV purchase subsidies.
    - Policy-driven Adoption: Analyze the role of the FAME II scheme and state-specific policies in driving sales.

4. Charging Infrastructure Development
    - Top States with EV Charging Network Growth:
        
         - Delhi: Dense network of charging stations.
         - Maharashtra: Significant infrastructure investment.
         - Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat: Strategic focus on expanding charging stations.
    - Correlate the availability of charging infrastructure with EV sales growth.

5. Year-on-Year Growth Comparison
    - Visualize growth trends in EV sales between 2023 and 2024.
    - Identify factors contributing to the acceleration or stagnation of adoption rates

  
## Dashboard Objectives in Power BI :

   - State-wise EV Sales Distribution: Create heatmaps or bar charts to show EV sales by state.
   - Customer Behavior Analysis: Use pie charts or KPIs to highlight key motivations like cost savings, environmental concerns, and incentives.
   - Policy Impact: Showcase the relationship between government incentives and adoption rates through scatter plots or trend lines.
   - Infrastructure Influence: Display charging station density and its effect on EV sales using maps and correlation analysis.
   - Year-on-Year Sales Growth: Track annual growth rates with line graphs or area charts.

## Expected Insights :

   - States with robust policies and infrastructure lead in EV adoption.
   - Customers are primarily motivated by cost savings and environmental benefits.
   - Charging station availability plays a pivotal role in driving EV sales.
   - Policy-driven incentives and subsidies significantly enhance market penetration.
   - Year-over-year data reveals the impact of initiatives and infrastructure investments on growth
